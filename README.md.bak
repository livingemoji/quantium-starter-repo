## Processed data output

A processed CSV containing only Pink Morsel sales has been generated at `data/processed_sales.csv`.

This file contains three columns: `Sales`, `Date`, and `Region`.

To regenerate it, run the processing script from the repository root:

```
python scripts\\process_sales.py
```

The script filters for product == "pink morsel" (case-insensitive), computes sales as price * quantity, and writes the combined output.
